# My Personal Dotfiles
These are my personal config files for vim, etc.

## Install Instructions
Run the following commands in the home directory (on Windows):
- `git clone https://github.com/reallyblackbuffalo/dotfiles .dotfiles`
- `.dotfiles\setupWin`

## Install Nerd Font
Some of the Neovim plugins require a [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) to show icons correctly.
Putting the link/details for the Nerd Font I'm using here so that I have quick access to it when installing on a new machine:
- https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code
- Download the zip archive from the latest release (not the source), then extract the archive to a folder.
- In the otf folder, select all of the CascadiaCodeNF and CascadiaMonoNF files, right click and select Install (might be different on non-Windows).
